        <div class="subheading mb-5"> Psychology üìö </div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a first year Psychology major, studying for my bachelor degree at the University of California, Riverside. In highschool, I had much experience with leadership, as I was involved in more than five clubs and held an officer position in three of them. I have done everything from speaking to public officials in support of mental health aids and information within school curriculum, to organizing and hosting events that showcase mental health information and resources to schools and communities. I have had the honor of receiving multiple awards for my contributions to my local community in mental health advocacy, including awards by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, for Contributions to Promoting Youth Voice in Mental Health, as I was one of three applicants awarded in the state. 
<br><br>

        During highschool, and outside of my mental health advocacy, I involved myself with my community through volunteering. In June of 2018, I had volunteered at the Heal The Bay sponsored ‚ÄúNothin‚Äô But Sand‚Äù beach cleanup in Venice Beach and Pier in California. Around July of that same year, I helped to prepare food baskets, organized produce and managed food scraps and waste for God Provides Food Bank in South El Monte. To further my skills in the studies that I would pursue, I became a registered and certified responder in Youth Mental Health First Aid USA to provide initial aid to those experiencing a mental health problem. I had also joined a program with the City of Hope, the Hilton Science and Nutrition Summer Research Program, in which I was involved in hands-on lab research as well as education on health, nutrition, and diabetes.<br><br>

        In pursuing my degree and continuing my education at the University of California Riverside, I hope to involve myself with the campus more and make an impact. As of now, I hold an officer position, as secretary of Drag Club at UCR, and in the fall of this upcoming year I will be a Peer Health Educator working with Golden Arches on campus. My hope for the upcoming years that I get to spend on campus is to involve myself in research on campus and contributing as well as working with the Psychology department. I would also hope to participate in internships involving marketing or political science, and finding a path through those fields that I am also interested in. I was previously offered an internship in my senior year of highschool to work in a medical lab, but could not participate due to my heavy schedule at the time of athletics, clubs, and dual enrollment programs with cal state colleges, but possibly involving myself in other medical related programs now is something that I would be interested in doing as well. I love psychology, and involving myself with mental health and mental illness related work, but I would also love to pursue other fields alongside that, and broaden my knowledge to other experiences that could prove useful towards finding success in my future career.
